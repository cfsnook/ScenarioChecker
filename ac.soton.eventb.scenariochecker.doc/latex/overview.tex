\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

The Scenario Checker is a tool to help develop useful Event-B models.
The Scenario Checker focusses on a behaviour-driven approach to validate model behaviour.
It is assumed that the Rodin automatic provers will be used to verify models.

The Scenario Checker allows scenarios to be animated and recorded while visualising state and event enabledness.
They can then be re-played after the model is modified to check for changes.
Events may be designated as internal (e.g. part of a controllers response to external stimuli) so that they are run automatically until completion (i.e. no more internal events are enabled). 
Private variables of the controller are ignored during playback.
Events may also be prioritised to resolve non-deterministic choices remaining in the model.
The Scenario Checker uses the ProB animator to execute the model.
